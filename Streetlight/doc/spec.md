Another variation source of this property are wall-mounted streetlights.  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `locationCategory`: Category of the location where the streetlight is placed. Enum:'bridge, centralIsland, façade, garden, park, parking, pedestrianPath, playground, road, sidewalk, tunnel'  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `powerState`: Streetlight's power state. Enum:'bootingUp, low, off, on'  - `refDevice`: Reference to the device(s) used to monitor this streetligth. List of Reference to entity(ies) of type Device.  - `refStreetlightControlCabinet`: If this streetlight is individually controlled, reference to the control cabinet in charge of.  - `refStreetlightGroup`: Streetlight's group, if this streetlight belongs to any group.  - `refStreetlightModel`: Streetlight's model.  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `status`: The overall status of this street light. Enum:'brokenLantern, columnIssue, defectiveLamp, ok'  - `type`: NGSI Entity type. It has to be Streetlight    
Required properties  
- `id`  - `location`  - `status`  - `type`    
An entity of type `Streetlight` represents a urban streetlight. Actually, there  will be an entity of type `Streetlight` per lamp. Thus, if a particular pole   holds more than one lantern there will be as many streetlight entites as   installed lamps. As a result there might be more than one streetlight entity per   location. A `Streetlight` entity does not contain any attribute corresponding to structural characteristics. Such data is captured by entities of type `StreetlightModel`.

#### Streetlight NGSI-v2 key-values Example    
Here is an example of a Streetlight in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.  
```json
